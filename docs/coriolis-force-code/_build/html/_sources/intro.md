Introduction
=============

This is a companion site to the 1989 classic text *An Introduction to the Coriolis Force* by Henry M. Stommel and Dennis W. Moore. All of the code for the exercises in the book originally were written in GW-BASIC. Here, the exercises have been rewritten in Python. 

The repository for the code is located at [https://github.com/torimcd/coriolis-sm](https://github.com/torimcd/coriolis-sm), and students are encouraged to fork the repository and play with the code. This site serves as documentation for the programs, and notes where changes have been made in the algorithms and variable names from what appears in the text.

The repository also contains copies of the original programs in GW-BASIC, along with instructions on how to run them in the PC-BASIC emulator, which is available for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux.
